    <h1>Modeling</h1>
    <p>As part of my job, I would sometimes have to stand in as a model. This could mean a lot of things, but mostly my duties
    were to stand and make sure the cleats were in the right position, clean, and looking good. As you can see below, I mostly shot with Adidas product by photographer <a href= "https://danielkobin.com/home">Daniel Kobin</a>,
  although I also shot with other brands. Sometimes, I would have to be photographed while in action, which is why it was convenient that
  I was a soccer player. This was one of my favorite parts of the internship because, although it meant long days out on the field, I got to basically
  play soccer and spend time with friends while working.
