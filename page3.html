       This series of images was shot by me as part of our marketing strategy for the PUMA Uprising pack. It features the black and orange PUMA Future 18.1 and the silver and orange PUMA One 18.1.
       The cleats were shot at the Finley training fields in Chapel Hill.
       You can find them at <a href="https://www.soccer.com/puma/">SOCCER.COM </a>.

           <p class= "flextext">This is the PUMA Future. It is known for it's ability to be laced in various ways. Its knit upper affords a very soft touch on the ball.</p>

           <p class= "flextext">The PUMA One is a less aggressive boot than the Future. Although it weighs more, its light leather gives the player a great feel for the ball while also protecting their foot.</p>
