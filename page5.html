         As my main project, I wanted to do something I'd never done before. Although I have had a lot of experience with visual media, I'd never worked extensively with audio.
         podcasts are always a medium that has interested me. As someone who loves sports podcasts, especially ones that focus on the human side of the game, I decided that
         something along those lines would be perfect for my project. Luckily, SOCCER.COM has been working with United States Soccer legend Heather O'Reilly on a collection
         to raise money for the US Soccer Foundation. As O'Reilly lives in Chapel Hill, I was able to set up an interview and we recorded the podcast.
