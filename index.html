<p>
This is my project page for INLS 572. I'm interested in Photography, Digital Marketing and Social Media strategy,
so having a personal website where I can showcase my work is important to me. That's why I will be creating a Personal
website where I can display my photos, design work, and personal achievements for potential employers to view.
<br>
<br>
I'm a photographer and social media coordinator from North Carolina currently working with <a href="https://www.soccer.com/" >SOCCER.COM</a>. I enjoy taking pictures, especially in a sports setting.
In addition to my main responsibility running the Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soccerdotcom_gk/" >@soccerdotcom_gk</a> (48k followers), my work has also
been published on the SOCCER.COM <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soccerdotcom/">Instagram</a> (3.7m followers) and
<a href="https://twitter.com/soccerdotcom">Twitter</a> (191k followers) accounts.
<br>
<br>
As for the next step, I'm exploring my options. I'm willing to to run the social media identities for sports teams and brands.
I'm also interested in digital marketing and strategy, so I would be thrilled to work for an agency that specializes in brand
management. I would love to go somewhere I've never lived, like Boston or Los Angeles, or even further abreast, like Spain or England.
