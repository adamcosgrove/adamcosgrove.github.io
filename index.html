  Adam Cosgrove's Internship Final Project
  </h1>

<p>
This is my project portfolio for my final project for COMM 393.
<br>
<br>
This semester, I served as a photographer and social media coordinator from North Carolina currently working with <a href="https://www.soccer.com/" >SOCCER.COM</a>. I enjoy taking pictures, especially in a sports setting.
In addition to my main responsibility running the Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soccerdotcom_gk/" >@soccerdotcom_gk</a> (48k followers), my work has also
been published on the SOCCER.COM <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soccerdotcom/">Instagram</a> (3.7m followers) and
<a href="https://twitter.com/soccerdotcom">Twitter</a> (191k followers) accounts.
<br>
<br>
I think the main thing that I wanted to get out of this project was new skills. Going in, I figured that would mean improving
at my photography and social media skills. However, I was pushed more than that. I learned different aspects of marketing strategy, such as
when to put things on sale and how many units to buy of a product. I learned about planning posts on Twitter and Instagram based on
analytics gathered from the sites to help determine what will perform well. I, possibly most important to me, also learned new skills
in content creation, especially with audio and HTML coding, which feature prominently in my final project.
<br>
<br>
That, along with some of my other work from this semester, can be found in the menu above and at the social links below. I hope you enjoy!
