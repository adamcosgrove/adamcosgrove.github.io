This is my project portfolio for my final project for COMM 393. <a href="page3.html">Page 2</a>.

This semester, I served as a photographer and social media coordinator from North Carolina currently working with <a href="https://www.soccer.com/" >SOCCER.COM</a>. I enjoy taking pictures, especially in a sports setting.
In addition to my main responsibility running the Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soccerdotcom_gk/" >@soccerdotcom_gk</a> (48k followers), my work has also
been published on the SOCCER.COM <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soccerdotcom/">Instagram</a> (3.7m followers) and
<a href="https://twitter.com/soccerdotcom">Twitter</a> (191k followers) accounts.
<br>
<br>
As my main project, I wanted to do something I'd never done before. Although I have had a lot of experience with visual media, I'd never worked extensively with audio.
Podcasts are always a medium that has interested me. As someone who loves sports podcasts, especially ones that focus on the human side of the game, I decided that
something along those lines would be perfect for my project. Luckily, SOCCER.COM has been working with United States Soccer legend Heather O'Reilly on a collection
to raise money for the US Soccer Foundation. As O'Reilly lives in Chapel Hill, I was able to set up an interview and we recorded the podcast.

That, along with a lot of other work from this semester, can be found in the menu above. I hope you enjoy!
